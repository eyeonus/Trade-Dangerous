    Base class for import plugins.

    Called by "import" as soon as argument parsing has been done.

    An import plugin implements "run()" and "finish()".

    On entry to the "import" function, before the database has
    been loaded or the cache file generated, the plugin's
    "run()" member is invoked.

    This function can do as much or as little work as you need.

    a specific download would return True.

    relevant to your plugin, return None or False and the command
    will early-out.

    "finish()" will then be called before the import command
    tries to import the data. This gives you an opportunity to
    modify, parse or even import the data yourself.

    Returning False from finish() ends processing, the import
    command will rebuild the main .prices file and exit. This
    allows you to write a plugin that does its own processing
    of a custom .prices format, for example.

    Returning True will allow the import command to proceed
    with import as normal. This allows, for example, a plugin
    that pre-processes the .prices file before import is called.
