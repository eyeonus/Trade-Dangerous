# TradeDangerous :: Command Line App :: Main Module
#
# TradeDangerous is a powerful set of tools for traders in Frontier
# Development's game "Elite: Dangerous". It's main function is
# calculating the most profitable trades between either individual
# stations or working out "profit runs".
#
# I wrote TD because I realized that the best trade run - in terms
# of the "average profit per stop" was rarely as simple as going
# Chango -> Dahan -> Chango.
#
# E:D's economy is complex; sometimes you can make the most profit
# by trading one item A->B and flying a second item B->A.
# But more often you need to fly multiple stations, especially since
# as you are making money different trade options are coming into
# your affordable range.
#
# END USERS: If you are a user looking to find out how to use TD,
# please consult the file "README.md".
#
# DEVELOPERS: If you are a programmer who wants TD to do something
# cool, please see the TradeDB and TradeCalc modules. TD is designed
# to empower other programmers to do cool stuff.
